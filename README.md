# -One-Unity-Game-
This is a repository created to store the scripts to a 3D Unity game I made

It is a first person story based, riddle solving game. It contains one scene and has collectable "orbs" which can only be found when following the story and the clues. The orbs activate one after another whenever the current orb is found the next one is triggered. The game also has implemented a save, load and new game system. It also has checkpoints that are triggered with the orbs, and which continue the player after death or restart of game. Finally, the lore of the game is stored in the pause menu prepared, so all the clues are accessible there as well. 

I used C# scripting purely, as is used by Unity Engine.
